	<h1>Time Complexity</h1>
	
	<p>The concept of <b>time complexity</b> plays a crucial role in analyzing the efficiency of algorithms. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of the input size. An algorithm with <strong>efficient</strong> time complexity completes its operations quickly even for large input sizes, ensuring optimal performance.</p>
    <h1>Space Complexity</h1>
	<p> <b>Space complexity</b> is another fundamental consideration in algorithm analysis. It quantifies the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the input size. Algorithms with better space complexity, such as <b>O(n)</b> space complexity, utilize memory efficiently, which is essential in memory-constrained environments</p>
