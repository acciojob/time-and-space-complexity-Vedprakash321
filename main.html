	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>The concept of Time complexity plays a crucial role in analyzing the efficiency of algorithms. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of the input size. An algorithm with efficient time complexity completes its operations quickly even for large input sizes, ensuring optimal performance.</p>
  
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another fundamental consideration in algorithm analysis. It quantifies the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the input size. Algorithms with better space complexity, such as O(n) space complexity, utilize memory efficiently, which is essential in memory-constrained environments</p>
